Technical and Comparative Study
================================

This covers the relevance of using the various technologies we are employing
(programming language, graphics library, algorithms, networking techniques, etc. . . ).

The project is been asked to be coded in *C++ language* using the graphical library of 
*SFML* following the algorithm of the original *RTYPE* game logic and making it available
over the network as well.

To encompass this, let's cover up what is been done and why it's been done that way.

* **Algorithms**

*  **Design patterns**

*  **Data structures for the project**

*  **as well as our selection of new and custom-designed algorithms** 


**Storage:** a study of different storage techniques should be included in our comparative study,
regarding persistence, reliability, and storage constraints.


**Security:** security and data integrity must be managed and secured effectively.
In our comparative study, it might be relevant to consider the main vulnerabilities
of each technology. Also, explain how we implemented the security monitoring of those
technologies, in the long term.
