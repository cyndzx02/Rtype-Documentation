The project (RTYPE)
####################
The goal is to implement a multi-threaded server and a graphical client for a well-known legacy
video game called R-Type, using a game engine of our own design.
First, we will develop the core architecture of the game and deliver a working prototype, and in a
second time, we will expand several aspects the prototype to the next level, exploring specialized
