CI/CD How-To's
**************

This document describes a GitHub Actions workflow used to automate the building of our R-type project on a Fedora image. The workflow is triggered by push and pull request events on the main and Engine branches.

Workflow structure
==================

The YAML file is structured in several sections:

The name
+++++++++

  .. code-block:: yaml

        name: workflow_linux

-This line defines the workflow name. Here, it is simply called workflow.

The events triggers
+++++++++++++++++++
    
    .. code-block:: yaml

        on:
        push:
        branches:
        - main
        - Engine
        pull_request:
        branches:
        - main
        - Engine

This section defines the events that trigger the workflow:
    - push: The workflow is executed when code is pushed to the main or Engine branches.
    - pull_request : The workflow runs when a pull request is opened to the main or Engine branches.


The Jobs
++++++++

The workflow contains a job called build_linux :

    .. code-block:: yaml

        jobs:
        build_linux:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container:
        image: fedora:latest

runs-on: Defines the environment where the job runs. Here, it's ubuntu-latest, but it uses a Fedora container.
container: Specifies the container image to be used for the job.

The job steps
+++++++++++++

Each job consists of steps that describe the actions to be performed:

- Check code:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml

        # Uses the checkout action to retrieve source code from the repository.
        - name: Check code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

- The example below describes how dependencies are installed:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
        sudo dnf -y update
        sudo dnf install -y boost-devel
        sudo dnf install -y SFML-devel
        sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++

Updates the system and installs the necessary dependencies for the project, based on all the libraries used in the project.

- Install Conan:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Install Conan
        run: |
        sudo dnf -y update
        sudo dnf install -y python3-pip
        pip3 install conan

Installs Conan, a C/C++ package manager. 
It makes it easy to integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, to automate dependency management when building our project.

- Check Conan version:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Check version conan
        run: conan --version

Checks that Conan has been installed correctly by displaying its version.

- Configure CMake:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Configure CMake
        run: |
        cmake -B build -S Engine \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Build \

Configures the project with CMake, specifying the compiler and build type.

- Compile the project:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Compile project
        run: |
        cd Engine
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make

Compiles the project in the build directory.

How to test the workflow
========================

Pushing modifications to GitHub
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    To trigger the workflow :

    #. Modify code in your local repository.
    #. Push the changes to the main or Engine branch:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            git add .
            git commit -m "Your commit message"
            git push origin main

Receive a message via Outlook
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To test the integration, the team will receive an e-mail indicating that changes have been made to the main or Engine branch. The message will mention that the workflow has been updated.
Example:
--------

        .. image:: images/outlook.png
            :width: 600

Check your workflow on GitHub
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    #. Access your repository on GitHub.
        .. image:: images/github.png
            :width: 600

    #. Click on the Actions tab. You'll see a list of executed workflows.

        Since we want to build two workflows (on linux and window), we'll have two different builds.

        .. image:: images/actions.png
            :width: 600

    #. Click on the latest workflow to see details of its execution, including logs and results for each step.

    - For linux:

        .. image:: images/build_linux.png
            :width: 600

    - For window:

        .. image:: images/build_window.png
            :width: 600
